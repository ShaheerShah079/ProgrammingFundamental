            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This repository contains all my practice work for the Programming Fundamentals course, implemented in the C language using Dev-C++. The exercises cover various basic to advanced programming concepts, aiming to build a strong foundation in C programming.
            </p>
            
<h2>Project Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Syntax:</strong> Programs demonstrating the basic syntax of C, including variables, data types, and operators.</li>
    <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> Exercises on control structures such as loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional statements (if, else, switch).</li>
    <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Practice work on defining and using functions, including recursion and function pointers.</li>
    <li><strong>Arrays and Strings:</strong> Programs handling arrays and strings, showcasing operations like sorting, searching, and manipulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Pointers:</strong> Exercises focusing on pointer usage, pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Structures and Unions:</strong> Programs demonstrating the use of structures and unions for handling complex data types.</li>
    <li><strong>File I/O:</strong> Examples of file input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files.</li>
    <li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Additional exercises covering a variety of topics to further enhance programming skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Run the Programs</h2>
<p>
    To run the C programs using Dev-C++, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download and install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/">Dev-C++</a> on your computer.</li>
    <li>Clone the repository using the following command:
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/programming-fundamentals-c.git</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Open Dev-C++ and navigate to <strong>File > Open Project or File</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select the desired C program file from the cloned repository.</li>
    <li>Compile and run the program using the <strong>Execute</strong> menu or by pressing <strong>F11</strong> to compile and <strong>F10</strong> to run.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Files Included</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source Code:</strong> All the C program files for the exercises mentioned above.</li>
    <li><strong>README.md:</strong> This README file providing an overview and instructions.</li>
</ul>
